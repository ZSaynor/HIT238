The interactive web application 'Cooking Assitant' is an application designed to help with recipe selection and preparation instructions. 
It was designed by Zac Saynor in unit HIT238 The Mobile Paradigm at CDU as assignment 1.
Hosted here on github pages is the first MVP prototype which currently contains:
- Home/Title page
- List of recipes page, with 5 examples
- Recipe details page for each example recipe with generic example data
- Interactive search bar for recipe list
- Interactive ingredients list for each recipe
- Visual design of the app
- Full dynamically sized content to fit any screen (still optimised for mobile however)

No large external libraries were used in the construction of the MVP
